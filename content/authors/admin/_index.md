I am a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at The University of Hong Kong, supervised by Professor Peng Lu. My research interests include legged robotics, reinforcement learning, and large language models.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2023, where I was supervised by Professor Lei Xie. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research in audio and speech recognition. Additionally, I led the Wheeled Group of the Football Robot Base, where we developed soccer competition robots for RoboCup-MSL. In 2021, my team won the national first prize in various robotics competitions.
