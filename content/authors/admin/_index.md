<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hello! I'm an MPhil student in Mechanical Engineering at <strong style="color: black;">The University of Hong Kong</strong>, supervised by <a href="https://www.mech.hku.hk/academic-staff/lu-p">Peng LU</a> at the <a href="https://arclab.hku.hk/">ArcLab</a>. My research focuses on enabling robots to interact with and learn from the real world, aiming to acquire human-like abilities.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I earned my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from <strong style="color: black;">Northwestern Polytechnical University</strong> in 2023, where I conducted research on audio speech recognition under the supervision of <a href="https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/en/xielei.html">Lei XIE</a> at the <a href="http://www.nwpu-aslp.org/english">ASLP Lab</a>.

<!-- Hello!  I'm a Mphil student in ME at The University of Hong Kong by [Peng LU](https://www.mech.hku.hk/academic-staff/lu-p) at the [ArcLab](https://arclab.hku.hk/). I work on enabling robots to interact with and learn in the real world, so as to acquire human-like abilities. 

I earned my Bachelor's degree in SE from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2023, where I conducted research on audio speech recognition under the supervision of Professor [Lei XIE](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/en/xielei.html) at the [ASLP Lab](http://www.nwpu-aslp.org/english).

<!-- I am an undergraduate majoring in software engineering at Northwestern Polytechnical University. My research interests include distributed robotics, embedded software and deep learning. I lead the Wheeled group of Football Robot Base, which develops Soccer competition robot for RoboCup-MSL. In 2021, my team won the national first prize in various robot competitions. -->

**I’m applying for a research internship(2024-25 entry).**
