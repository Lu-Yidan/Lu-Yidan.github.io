title: I borrowed an Unitree go1 robot! I'm implenting "learing for leged locomotion"! 


subtitle: 

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: At the end of my last year of college. I decide to do some work about learing for leged locomotion. I hope to publish a CCFB by 2023.

## Model-based Optimization-Based Control

**Exp 1: Gait and Trajectory Optimization for Legged Systems Through Phase-Based End-Effector Parameterization**
* Planning: 
foot flight time
foot landing position
* Constraints: 
kinematics constraints
Friction constraints
Contact constraints
* Cost Function:
Distance to goal


**Exp 2: Highly dynamic quadruped locomotion via whole-body impulse control and model predictive control**
* Planning: 
Ground reaction force
* Constraints: 
kinematics constraints
Friction constraints
Contact constraints
* Cost Function:
Distance to the desired state
